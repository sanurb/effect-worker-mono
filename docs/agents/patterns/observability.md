# Observability

How to wire up tracing, logging, and metrics with Effect and OpenTelemetry.

## Why

Effect has built-in support for structured logging, spans, and metrics. By wiring these into OpenTelemetry, you get full observability with minimal code — traces show the call tree of your Effect programs, logs carry span context, and metrics are exported automatically.

For development, a console exporter lets agents inspect structured traces without external infrastructure. For production, swap in an OTLP exporter to send data to Jaeger, Honeycomb, Grafana, etc.

## Console Exporter (Development)

The simplest setup — traces print to stdout as structured JSON. Good for development and for agents debugging runtime behavior.

```typescript
import * as NodeSdk from "@effect/opentelemetry/NodeSdk";
import { ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { pipe } from "effect/Function";

// Create the tracing layer
const TracingLive = NodeSdk.layer(() => ({
  resource: {
    serviceName: "my-service",
  },
  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter()),
}));

// Use Effect.withSpan to create spans
const program = pipe(
  Effect.log("Processing item"),
  Effect.withSpan("process-item"),
  Effect.withSpan("main"),
);

// Provide the tracing layer at the edge
pipe(program, Effect.provide(TracingLive), Effect.runFork);
```

### Required packages

```bash
bun add effect @effect/opentelemetry @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node
```

## OTLP Exporter (Production / Jaeger / Grafana)

Effect includes a lightweight OTLP module that sends traces, logs, and metrics over HTTP — no heavy SDK dependencies needed.

```typescript
import * as Otlp from "@effect/opentelemetry/Otlp";
import * as OtlpSerialization from "@effect/opentelemetry/OtlpSerialization";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "@effect/platform";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

// Send to a local Jaeger/Grafana Tempo/Honeycomb endpoint
const TracingLive = Otlp.layerJson({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:4318",
  resource: {
    serviceName: "my-service",
    serviceVersion: "1.0.0",
  },
}).pipe(Layer.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer));
```

### Required packages (OTLP)

```bash
bun add effect @effect/opentelemetry @effect/platform
```

## Env-Var-Gated Tracing

In development, you usually want tracing off by default and toggled on with a single env var. Use `EFFECT_TRACE=1` to enable console trace export:

```typescript
import * as NodeSdk from "@effect/opentelemetry/NodeSdk";
import { ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

const TracingLive = process.env["EFFECT_TRACE"]
  ? NodeSdk.layer(() => ({
      resource: { serviceName: "my-service" },
      spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter()),
    }))
  : Layer.empty;
```

Wire `TracingLive` into your `AppContext` layer. When `EFFECT_TRACE` is unset, tracing is a no-op. This pattern works for any app type -- CLI, API, or worker.

## Structured Logging with Span Context

Replace the default logger with `Logger.json` + `Logger.withSpanAnnotations` to get machine-readable logs with trace correlation:

```typescript
import { Logger } from "effect";

const DevLoggingLive = Logger.replace(
  Logger.defaultLogger,
  Logger.jsonLogger.pipe(Logger.withSpanAnnotations),
);
```

Every log line gets `effect.traceId`, `effect.spanId`, and `effect.spanName` as structured fields. This makes logs searchable and correlated with their parent spans.

Pair with the `no-interpolated-logging` ast-grep rule -- when logs are structured JSON, string interpolation in log messages defeats the purpose. Pass data as separate arguments instead.

## Adding Spans to Your Code

Effect.withSpan wraps any Effect in a trace span:

```typescript
const fetchUser = (id: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const db = yield* DatabaseService;
    return yield* db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [id]);
  }).pipe(Effect.withSpan("fetchUser", { attributes: { userId: id } }));

const processRequest = (userId: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const user = yield* fetchUser(userId);
    const result = yield* transformUser(user);
    return result;
  }).pipe(Effect.withSpan("processRequest"));
```

This produces a trace tree:

```
processRequest
└── fetchUser (userId: "123")
```

## Logging with Span Context

Effect.log automatically carries span context — logs are correlated with their parent span:

```typescript
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Starting processing");
  const data = yield* fetchData();
  yield* Effect.log("Fetched data", { count: data.length });
  const result = yield* transformData(data);
  yield* Effect.logWarning("Slow transform detected");
  return result;
}).pipe(Effect.withSpan("pipeline"));
```

With the OTLP exporter, these logs appear in your observability backend with full trace context.

## Integrating with Service Layers

Add the tracing layer to your app's layer composition:

```typescript
import { Layer } from "effect";

// Compose all layers
const AppContext = Layer.mergeAll(ConfigLive, DatabaseLive, TracingLive);

// Provide once at the edge
Effect.runFork(program.pipe(Effect.provide(AppContext)));
```

For CLI apps using `Effect.runMain`:

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const main = program.pipe(Effect.provide(AppContext));

Effect.runMain(main);
```

## Reading Trace Output (for Agents)

With the console exporter, spans print as JSON to stdout. Key fields:

- `name` — the span name from `Effect.withSpan`
- `traceId` / `spanId` — identifiers for correlation
- `parentId` — links to parent span (shows the call tree)
- `duration` — how long the span took (in microseconds)
- `status` — `OK`, `ERROR`, or `UNSET`
- `attributes` — custom data attached via `Effect.withSpan`
- `events` — logs emitted within the span

Agents can grep stdout for specific span names or trace IDs to understand program behavior without stepping through code.
